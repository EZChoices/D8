      <p>
        We source, process, and stage THCA flower and concentrates for licensed buyers who need predictable quality and transparent
        documentation. No middlemenâ€”just vetted partners and direct fulfillment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team focuses on wholesale readiness: compliance reviews, pallet staging, and batch-level COAs so your retail partners or
        manufacturing lines can move quickly. Retail is secondary and limited to compliant ingestibles.
